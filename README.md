## Frontend 
To run the app, first double click SteadFit.xcodeproj in the root folder to open the Xcode project. Select the SteadFit project (should be the topmost item) in the sidebar. A new pane should pop up–within that, select the section that says Signing & Capabilities. You will need to select a team to use when building and running the app. You will also need to select a device to run the project, it can either be a simulator or an actual device. To run the app on an actual device, please connect it to your computer via a cable. To run the project, click the run button on the top left of the screen. The first run will take around 1-2 minutes, subsequent runs will build and run faster.
